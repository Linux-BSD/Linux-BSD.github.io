      <description>This blog post describes my setup for monitoring various devices on my home network suh as servers, laptops/desktops, networking gear etc. The setup and configuration is squarely geared towards small/medium sized network monitoring. A similar setup might work for large networks, but you will need to plan your compute/storage/bandwidth capacities accordingly. I&amp;rsquo;m running all the monitoring software on FreeBSD, but you can run it on your choice of OS. Just make sure to install the packages using your OS&amp;rsquo;s package manager.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting this blog to document my adventures in using the FreeBSD operating system as my daily driver since March of 2021. Although I had used FreeBSD sparingly in the past and mostly for server purposes, this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;m switching over completely to FreeBSD as a workstation. I hope to document all the pros and cons of such a setup as impartially as I can.
Personal History I first started using Computers back in early 1990s.</description>
